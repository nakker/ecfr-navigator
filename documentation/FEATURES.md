# Key Features and Functionality

## Core Features Overview

The eCFR Analyzer provides comprehensive tools for analyzing federal regulations through automated data retrieval, AI-powered insights, and interactive visualizations.

## Automated Data Retrieval

### CFR Download and Updates
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Downloads complete CFR XML data from govinfo.gov every 24 hours
- **Change Detection**: SHA256 checksums identify modified titles, skipping unchanged content
- **Version Tracking**: Captures regulation changes over time from eCFR API versioning endpoints
- **Progress Resumption**: Interrupted downloads resume from last successful position
- **Large File Handling**: Supports titles up to 500+ MB with compression and GridFS storage

### Version History
- **Timeline Visualization**: Interactive timeline showing when regulations were last updated
- **Change Frequency**: Tracks how often each title receives updates
- **Historical Comparison**: Maintains version metadata for trend analysis

## Analysis Metrics

### Text Complexity Metrics
1. **Word Count**: Accurate word counting excluding numbers and punctuation
2. **Complexity Score (0-100)**: Calculated using:
   - Average sentence length (40% weight)
   - Complex word percentage - words with 3+ syllables (40% weight)
   - Sentence length variation (20% weight)
3. **Flesch Reading Ease (0-100)**: Standard readability formula where:
   - 90-100: Very easy (5th grade)
   - 60-70: Standard (8th-9th grade)
   - 0-30: Very difficult (college graduate)
4. **Average Sentence Length**: Words per sentence indicator
5. **Keyword Frequency**: Counts of configurable regulatory terms (e.g., "compliance", "penalty", "requirement")

### AI-Powered Analysis

#### Section Analysis (via Grok API)
Each regulation section receives three AI evaluations:

1. **Summary**: One-sentence description of the section's purpose and requirements
2. **Antiquated Score (1-100)**:
   - Measures how outdated the language, concepts, or requirements are
   - Considers references to obsolete technology, processes, or standards
   - Includes explanation of why the score was assigned
3. **Business Unfriendly Score (1-100)**:
   - Assesses regulatory burden on businesses
   - Evaluates compliance costs, complexity, and operational restrictions
   - Provides reasoning for the score

## AI Chatbot

### Context-Aware Assistant
- **Title-Specific Context**: Automatically loads relevant regulation content when viewing a title
